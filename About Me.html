	<center><p> Hi there! My name is Rithvik Vakacharla, and I am a Junior at The Honors College at Rutgers University 
				majoring in Political Science and Finance. I was born in India and immigrated to the United States when I was six-years-old with my parents
				and twin brother. This upcoming summer, I will be working at Perella Weinberg Partners as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst.
				Last summer (2020), I worked at Bruderman & Company as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst and operated my investment research firm, V Capital, as the Managing Partner.
				Earlier, I worked at Knowt, an education technology, as the main finance lead when they raise at a $1M+ valuation, at Ravine Capital as a Private Equity Summer Analyst, and Moody's Investors
				Service as a Ratings Extern. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rithvikvakacharla/">LinkedIn</a>.
